## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript Vanilla

### What I learned

This project helped me to:
- Learn the basics about validating forms and inputs in form inputs.
- Save the prices, in this case of the plans, to later show them depending on whether the plan is annual or monthly.
- A little more CSS layout.


### Continued development

I think that my weakness is still CSS... Mostly because I did a couple of tricks which I'm aware are not good language practices, but I'm practicing to learn how to layout correctly.
